# DKNet.Svc.BlobStorage.Abstractions

This project provides abstractions and interfaces for blob storage services within the DKNet framework. It defines contracts for interacting with various blob storage providers (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, local storage), enabling flexible and provider-agnostic implementations.

## Features
- Blob storage service interfaces
- Common data structures for blob operations
- Extensible for multiple storage backends

## Usage
Reference this library to implement or consume blob storage services in a provider-independent way.
