# .NET 9 Project Coding Standards and Best Practices

## Naming Conventions
- **PascalCase** for:
  - Class names
  - Method names
- **camelCase** for:
  - Local variables
  - Method parameters
- Prefix interfaces with an **'I'** (e.g., `IExampleInterface`).

## Asynchronous Programming
- Utilize **asynchronous programming patterns** with `async` and `await` for I/O-bound or long-running operations.

## Exception Handling
- Implement robust **exception handling**:
  - Avoid empty `catch` blocks.
  - Catch specific exception types instead of general ones.

## LINQ Usage
- Leverage **Language Integrated Query (LINQ)** methods for:
  - Collection and array manipulations
  - Enhancing code readability and maintainability

## SOLID Principles
- Adhere to the **SOLID** principles:
  - **Single Responsibility Principle**: A class should have only one reason to change.
  - **Open/Closed Principle**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
  - **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.
  - **Interface Segregation Principle**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
  - **Dependency Inversion Principle**: Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.

## XML Documentation
- Provide **XML documentation comments** for all public members to:
  - Facilitate better code understanding
  - Enhance maintainability

## Using Statements
- Place `using` statements at the **top of the file**.
- Remove any **unnecessary namespaces** to maintain code cleanliness.

## Unit Testing
- For every new feature or module:
  - Write corresponding **unit tests** using frameworks like MSTest, NUnit, or xUnit.
  - Ensure code reliability and facilitate future refactoring.

## Dependency Injection
- Implement **dependency injection** to:
  - Manage class dependencies
  - Enhance code modularity and testability

## Thread Safety
- In multi-threaded applications:
  - Ensure that shared resources are accessed in a **thread-safe** manner.
  - Prevent race conditions and ensure data integrity.

## Domain-Driven Design (DDD) with MediatR
- **Aggregate Roots**:
  - Ensure that all business logic and invariants are enforced within aggregate roots.
  - Aggregate roots should be the only entry point for modifying related entities.

- **Domain Events**:
  - Use **domain events** to capture significant occurrences within the domain.
  - Implement domain events by creating event classes that implement `INotification` from MediatR.
  - Publish domain events through MediatR to notify other parts of the system about state changes.

- **Command and Query Separation**:
  - Apply the **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)** pattern:
    - **Commands**: Encapsulate operations that change state.
    - **Queries**: Encapsulate operations that retrieve data without changing state.
  - Use MediatR to handle commands and queries, promoting a clean separation of concerns.

- **Validation**:
  - Perform **request validation** using MediatR pipelines or decorators.
  - Implement **business rule validation** within the domain model to ensure consistency and integrity.

- **Repositories**:
  - Use repositories to abstract data access, ensuring that the domain model remains persistence-ignorant.
  - Repositories should return aggregate roots and handle the persistence of aggregates.

- **Modularity**:
  - Organize code into modules that align with bounded contexts.
  - Each module should encapsulate related aggregates, entities, value objects, and domain services.

- **Eventual Consistency**:
  - Where immediate consistency is not feasible, design for eventual consistency using domain events and asynchronous processing.

- **MediatR Integration**:
  - Use MediatR to decouple the application layers:
    - **Application Layer**: Handles commands and queries.
    - **Domain Layer**: Contains the business logic and domain entities.
  - Avoid direct dependencies between the application and domain layers; instead, communicate through MediatR.

- **Best Practices**:
  - Keep the domain model free from external dependencies to maintain purity.
  - Use MediatR's pipeline behaviors for cross-cutting concerns like logging, validation, and transaction management.
  - Ensure that each command and query has a single responsibility and is handled by a dedicated handler.

By following these guidelines, your .NET 9 projects will be well-structured, maintainable, and aligned with modern best practices, effectively integrating DDD principles with MediatR.
