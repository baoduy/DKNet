### Description
Enhance the `GenerateDto` attribute in the `DKNet.EfCore.DtoGenerator` to include a new flag named `IgnoreComplexType`.\n\n### Feature Details\n- **Flag Name**: `IgnoreComplexType`\n- **Functionality**: When this flag is set to `true`, the following properties should be automatically ignored during DTO generation:\n  - Properties that link to other entities (usually represented as classes without the `Owned` attribute).\n  - Both collection properties and single entity properties that fit the above criteria.\n\n### Benefits\n- Provides more granular control over DTO generation.\n- Simplifies the exclusion of complex types from generated DTOs.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- Add a `IgnoreComplexType` flag to the `GenerateDto` attribute.\n- Implement logic to automatically ignore complex types (as described above) when the flag is set to `true`.\n- Ensure the feature is covered by unit tests to validate its behavior.\n\n### References\n- Repository: [DKNet.EfCore.DtoGenerator](https://github.com/baoduy/DKNet)
